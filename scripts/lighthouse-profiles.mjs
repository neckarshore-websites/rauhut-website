/**
 * Canonical Lighthouse profiles for the neckarshore-ecosystem websites.
 *
 * Pure data module — NO side effects — so it can be imported by both the
 * runner (`lighthouse.mjs`) and the regression test (`lighthouse-profiles.test.mjs`).
 * Kept byte-identical across the site family (neckarshore / goldoni / rauhut / …)
 * so the gate behaves the same everywhere.
 *
 * ── Three profiles (corrected 2026-06-18, German Rauhut directive) ──────────
 *   1. Desktop    — LAN baseline, `--preset=desktop`, 1× CPU
 *   2. Mobile 5G  — fast network (~50 Mbps, RTT 20 ms), 4× CPU
 *   3. Mobile 4G  — Lighthouse Slow-4G default (~1.6 Mbps, RTT 150 ms), 4× CPU
 *
 * Network ordering is now CORRECT: 5G is faster than 4G.
 *
 * The pre-2026-06-18 "Mobile Slow (Edge-5G)" profile (400 Kbps / 6× CPU) is
 * DELETED. 400 Kbps is *slower* than 4G, so the "5G" label inverted reality —
 * a mislabel first flagged 2026-04-10 and corrected family-wide here. Sub-4G
 * traffic is out of scope: the target audience is 5G-default, and we do not gate
 * quality on an unserviceable edge-of-coverage scenario.
 *
 * ── Gate semantics (German Rauhut directive 2026-06-18) ─────────────────────
 *   - performance is SOFT on EVERY profile — an advisory warning line, never a
 *     hard gate. Perf scores track shared-runner CPU jitter, not the site, so a
 *     hard perf gate cried wolf and was admin-bypassed repeatedly. Visibility is
 *     kept (warning + logged LCP/TBT/CLS + run-to-run delta); the auto-block is
 *     dropped. Explicitly: NO hard perf gate on 4G — we do not block on an
 *     old-tech network the audience has moved past.
 *   - accessibility / best-practices / seo are HARD @95 on every profile. These
 *     are deterministic (the site hits 100) — a drop is a real defect, not noise.
 *
 * The per-metric soft override is expressed via `softMetrics`. A metric listed
 * there warns instead of failing the build, even on an otherwise-hard profile.
